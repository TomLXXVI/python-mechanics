# python-mechanics

A Python library for calculating stresses and deformations of beams and shafts 
under external loads.

Want to know what this library can do and how to use it? Check out the 
sample scripts in the *docs/examples* folder.

The examples are taken from the (e)book **Mechanics of Materials in SI Units, 
10th Edition** by *Russell C. Hibbeler*. It is recommended to have this book to 
better understand and see the context of the problems that are solved in the 
example scripts.

Concerning any sign conventions, the same right-handed coordinate system is used
throughout the library. This coordinate system is explained in the document 
*right-handed-coordinate-system.pdf* that can be found in the folder 
*docs/notes*.
