The second point is at the right end of the beam (point B). The x-coordinate of point B is at 3.6 m. The load per unit length at point A is 300 N/m and vertically downward. The x-axis of our coordinate system coincides with the horizontal centerline of the beam and is pointing to the right. As the coordinate system must be right-handed, the y-axis, going through the origin at point A, runs vertically and is pointing upward.
