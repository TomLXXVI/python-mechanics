# The solid shaft and tube shown in [Fig. 5â€“8] are made of a material having an
# allowable shear stress of 75 MPa. Determine the maximum torque that can be
# applied to each cross section, and show the stress acting on a small element
# of material at point A of the shaft, and points B and C of the tube.
